Here is my arxiv reading list for March 2019. New preprints this month reported breakthroughs in continuous variable quantum computation ([Walshe et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02162). and [Asavanant et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03918)); an almost perfect quantum-dot based photon-pair source by [Wang et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06071); and surprising theory that noise can induce amplification in bosonic channels by [Chia et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09370)

  > A procedure to construct useful continuous variable states using photon catalysis. Photon catalysis is the interference of coherent states with single-photon states followed by post-selection using photon-number-resolved detection. With these tools, the preprint provides schemes to construct exact displaced single-photon states, squeezed cat states, and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states.

    > Thermal squeezed states are as good as vacuum squeezed states for fault-tolerance in continuous variable (CV) quantum computing. This preprint generalizes the important [earlier result](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.112.120504) that CV cluster states created from squeezed vacuum states can be used for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Thermal states introduce an anti-squeezing, which could have  led to much more stringent squeezing requirements for fault tolerance, but this does not happen: the 20.5 dB squeezed-vacuum threshold works just as well for the squeezed thermal states.

[arXiv:1903.03918](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03918). _Time-Domain Multiplexed 2-Dimensional Cluster State: Universal Quantum Computing Platform_.

    > Experimental generation of a 5X5000 node two-dimensional CV cluster state. This experiment uses time-multiplexing, i.e., reusing spatial modes in time, to generate the states. In an incredible feat of stabilization, time multiplexing is performed with a 12m free-space delay line and a 40m optical fiber in the setup.

[arXiv:1903.06071](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06071). _On-demand semiconductor source of entangled photons which simultaneously has high fidelity, efficiency, and indistinguishability_.

  > Deterministic source if entangled photon pairs. The source uses resonant excitation of quantum dot in a bullseye cavity. The specs are remarkable: entanglement fidelity is 90%, pair generation rate 59%, pair extraction efficiency 62%, and photon indistinguishability of 90% (93%) without (with) temporal filtering.

  > Experimental demonstration of dephasing in different basis effecting states differently. GHZ and cluster states respond differently to noise in the computational (0/1) and the transverse (+/-) basis. Specifically, the entanglement decays exponentially fast with the size of a GHZ state under a dephasing noise in the computational basis. Dephasing noise is simulated on polarization qubits by applying individual phase flips on the photons; this aspect of the experimental design is ingenious.

  > Bosonic channel in which multiplicative noise can amplify an input signal. Surprising noise channel in which the noise induces an amplification of an input signal. The channel is modelled by a single bosonic oscillator coupled to a gain medium comprising two-level atoms that mediate two-photon transition. The amplification results from classical correlation between the internal noise source of the amplifier and the signal that is being amplified.

  > Self-phase modulation instead of parametric down conversion for continuous-wave squeezed vacuum light. Self-phase modulation, i.e., fully degenerate four-wave mixing, is an alternative to parametric down conversion that does not require light at twice the frequency. So far, squeezing via self-phase modulation was only observed in light pulses but this preprint reports the same in continuous wave light. Obtaining the squeezing required a careful control of the temperature to suppress the unwanted second harmonic generation process.
