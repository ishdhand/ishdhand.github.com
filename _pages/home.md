## About me

I am a photonics quantum computing researcher at the [University of Ulm](https://www.uni-ulm.de/en/).

Earlier, I headed [Xanadu](https://xanadu.ai/)'s Architecture team, where I led the theoretical effort to [design Xanadu's  quantum computer](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2021-02-04-392/) and to chart the [path to quantum advantage with photonics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12474).

During my postdoctoral research, my colleagues and I performed the [world-record tomography of a 14-qubit computer](https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys4244), and we [devised novel optical quantum simulators](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.130501). 

My PhD focussed on powerful new methods for the [design, characterization and simulation of photonic quantum computers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07476).

A list of patents is available on request.

I am an author of a book under contract with Cambridge University Press. This book explains the counter-intuitive properties of quantum physics requiring minimal mathematics background. An open-access outline is available on [arXiv:1806.09958](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09958).
