* Ish Dhand and Sandeep K. Goyal, Realization of arbitrary discrete unitary transformations using spatial and internal modes of light,
[arXiv:1508.06259](http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06259).  
  <Small>Abstract: Any lossless transformation on n_s spatial and n_p internal modes of light can be described by an n_sn_p×n_sn_p unitary matrix, but no procedure to effect arbitrary n_sn_p×n_sn_p unitary matrix on the combined spatial and internal modes is known. We devise an algorithm to realize an arbitrary discrete unitary transformation on the combined spatial and internal degrees of freedom of light. Our realization uses beamsplitters and operations on internal modes to effect arbitrary linear transformations. The number of beamsplitters required to realize a unitary transformation is reduced as compared to existing realization by a factor equal to the dimension of the employed internal degree of freedom. Our algorithm thus enables the optical implementation of higher dimensional unitary transformations.</Small>.
  
* Ish Dhand, Abdullah Khalid, He Lu and Barry C. Sanders, Accurate and precise characterization of linear optical interferometers,
[arXiv:1508.00283](http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.00283).  
  <Small>Abstract: We combine single- and two-photon interference procedures for characterizing any multi-port linear optical interferometer accurately and precisely. Accuracy is achieved by estimating and correcting systematic errors that arise due to spatiotemporal and polarization mode mismatch. Enhanced precision is attained by curve fitting to measured quantities based on a Poissonian shot noise assumption, and we employ bootstrapping statistics to quantify the resultant degree of precision. A scattershot approach is devised to effect a reduction in the experimental time required to characterize the interferometer.</Small>.

* Ish Dhand, Barry C. Sanders and Hubert de Guise, Algorithms for SU(n) boson realizations and D-functions,
[arXiv: 1507.06274](http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.06274).  
  <Small>Abstract: Boson realizations map operators and states of groups to transformations and states of bosonic systems. We devise a graph-theoretic algorithm to construct the boson realizations of the canonical SU(n) basis states, which reduce the canonical subgroup chain, for arbitrary n. The boson realizations are employed to construct D-functions, which are the matrix elements of arbitrary irreducible representations, of SU(n) in the canonical basis. We demonstrate that our D-function algorithm offers significant advantage over the two competing procedures, namely factorization and exponentiation</Small>.
  
* Ish Dhand and Barry C. Sanders, Stability of the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition,
[Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical](http://iopscience.iop.org/1751-8121/47/26/265206/) 47 (26), 265206.  [ArXiV: 1403.3469](http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.3469).  
  <Small>Abstract: The Trotter-Suzuki decomposition is an important tool for the simulation and control of physical systems. We provide evidence for the stability of the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition. We model the error in the decomposition and determine sufficiency conditions that guarantee the stability of this decomposition under this model. We relate these sufficiency conditions to precision limitations of computing and control in both classical and quantum cases. Furthermore we show that bounded-error Trotter-Suzuki decomposition can be achieved by a suitable choice of machine precision</Small>.
