## News
----------------
* **2017-06-05** We have a new preprint out on arXiv titled [Robust techniques for polarization and detection of nuclear spin ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01315). This preprint introduces methods for the control and readout of spin polarization via the NV center in diamond. These methods are an important step towards employing nanodiamonds as MRI tracers.

* **2016-12-23** We have a new preprint out on arXiv titled [Efficient tomography of a quantum many-body system](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08000). This preprint presents the first experimental demonstration of efficient quantum state tomography on a 14-qubit trapped-ion simulator, which is far beyond the reach of usual quantum state tomography.
