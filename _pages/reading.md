### March 2019  

<!--Here is my arxiv reading list for March 2019. New preprints this month reported breakthroughs in continuous variable quantum computation ([Walshe et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02162). and [Asavanant et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03918)); an almost perfect quantum-dot based photon-pair source by [Wang et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06071); and surprising theory that noise can induce amplification in bosonic channels by [Chia et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09370)-->

- Singh, A. P., Ast, S., Mehmet, M., Vahlbruch, H., & Schnabel, R. [arXiv:1903.09997](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09997). _Continuous-wave squeezed vacuum states of light via self-phase modulation_.

  > Self-phase modulation instead of parametric down conversion for continuous-wave squeezed vacuum light. Self-phase modulation, i.e., fully degenerate four-wave mixing, is an alternative to parametric down conversion that does not require light at twice the frequency. So far, squeezing via self-phase modulation was only observed in light pulses but this preprint reports the same in continuous wave light. Obtaining the squeezing required a careful control of the temperature to suppress the unwanted second harmonic generation process.

- Chia, A., Hajdusek, M., Nair, R., Fazio, R., Kwek, L. C., & Vedral, V. [arXiv:1903.08667](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09370). _Noise-induced amplification: Parametric amplifiers cannot simulate all phase-preserving linear amplifiers_.

  > Bosonic channel in which multiplicative noise can amplify an input signal. Surprising noise channel in which the noise induces an amplification of an input signal. The channel is modelled by a single bosonic oscillator coupled to a gain medium comprising two-level atoms that mediate two-photon transition. The amplification results from classical correlation between the internal noise source of the amplifier and the signal that is being amplified.

- Proietti, M., Ringbauer, M., Graffitti, F., Barrow, P., Pickston, A., Kundys, D., Cavalcanti, D., Aolita, L., Chaves, R., & Fedrizzi, A. [arXiv:1903.08667](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08667). _Experimental Multi-Qubit Robustness by Local Encoding_.  

  > Experimental demonstration of dephasing in different basis effecting states differently. GHZ and cluster states respond differently to noise in the computational (0/1) and the transverse (+/-) basis. Specifically, the entanglement decays exponentially fast with the size of a GHZ state under a dephasing noise in the computational basis. Dephasing noise is simulated on polarization qubits by applying individual phase flips on the photons; this aspect of the experimental design is ingenious.

- Wang, H., Hu, H., Chung, T.-H., Qin, J., Yang, X., Li, J.-P., Liu, R.-Z., Zhong, H.-S., He, Y.-M., Ding, X., Deng, Y.-H., Schneider, C., Dai, Q., Huo, Y.-H., Höfling, S., Lu, C.-Y., & Pan, J.-W. [arXiv:1903.06071](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06071). _On-demand semiconductor source of entangled photons which simultaneously has high fidelity, efficiency, and indistinguishability_.

  > Deterministic source if entangled photon pairs. The source uses resonant excitation of quantum dot in a bullseye cavity. The specs are remarkable: entanglement fidelity is 90%, pair generation rate 59%, pair extraction efficiency 62%, and photon indistinguishability of 90% (93%) without (with) temporal filtering.

- Asavanant, W., Shiozawa, Y., Yokoyama, S., Charoensombutamon, B., Emura, H., Alexander, R. N., Takeda, S., Yoshikawa, J., Menicucci, N. C., Yonezawa, H., & Furusawa, A. [arXiv:1903.03918](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.03918). _Time-Domain Multiplexed 2-Dimensional Cluster State: Universal Quantum Computing Platform_\.

  > Experimental generation of a 5X5000 node two-dimensional CV cluster state. This experiment uses time-multiplexing, i.e., reusing spatial modes in time, to generate the states. In an incredible feat of stabilization, time multiplexing is performed with a 12m free-space delay line and a 40m optical fiber in the setup.

- Walshe, B. W., Mensen, L. J., Baragiola, B. Q., & Menicucci, N. C. [arXiv:1903.02162](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.02162). _Robust fault tolerance for continuous-variable cluster states with excess anti-squeezing_\.

  > Thermal squeezed states are as good as vacuum squeezed states for fault-tolerance in continuous variable (CV) quantum computing. This preprint generalizes the important [earlier result](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.112.120504) that CV cluster states created from squeezed vacuum states can be used for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Thermal states introduce an anti-squeezing, which could have  led to much more stringent squeezing requirements for fault tolerance, but this does not happen: the 20.5 dB squeezed-vacuum threshold works just as well for the squeezed thermal states.

- Eaton, M., Nehra, R., & Pfister, O. [arXiv:1903.01925](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01925). _Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill state preparation by photon catalysis_\.

  > A procedure to construct useful continuous variable states using photon catalysis. Photon catalysis is the interference of coherent states with single-photon states followed by post-selection using photon-number-resolved detection. With these tools, the preprint provides schemes to construct exact displaced single-photon states, squeezed cat states, and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states.

### January 2019

<!--Here are notes from the quantum optics preprints that I enjoyed reading in January 2019. For me, the highlights included a recipe for constructing linear optical circuits for a given quantum operation (by [Garcia-Escartin et al.](http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.06178)) and reports of Hong-Ou-Mandel interference from on-chip weak-coherent sources (by [Semenenko et al.](http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05706) and [Agnesi et al.](http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05707)).-->

- Bozkurt, A. B., & Kocaman, S. [arXiv:1901.10369](http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10369). _Linear Optical Deterministic and Reconfigurable SWAP Gate_.

  > A design of a SWAP/identity reconfigurable gate in dual-rail basis. Figure 2 is a simple setup of a SWAP gate on two dual-rail qubits. The gate uses two mode-swaps (aka waveguide crossings), two MZIs. The gate is deterministic and much simpler than what one would get by laying out three CNOTs in series.

- Chapman, J. C., Graham, T. M., Zeitler, C. K., & Kwiat, P. G. [arXiv:1901.07181](http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07181). _Time-bin and Polarization Superdense Teleportation for Space Applications_.

  > A blueprint for superdense teleportation with ISS. This preprint proposes using time-bin and polarization together allow for superdense teleportation with a space-based station. It shows that 10^5 distinguishable states can be transmitted with an average fidelity of 94±2% and that states can be reconstructed using the light received from a single pass of the space station.

- Trivedi, R., Fischer, K., Vuckovic, J., & Muller, K. [arXiv:1901.06367](http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.06367). _Generation of non-classical light using semiconductor quantum dots_.

  > Thorough review on generating non-classical light with quantum dots. The review starts from the basics of quantum light and its interaction with matter. From there, it builds up to schemes for generating single photons, pairs of entangled photons and all the way till schemes for generating graph states. Great to see a detailed review on this fast growing topic!

- Garcia-Escartin, J. C., Gimeno, V., & Moyano-Fernández, J. J. [arXiv:1901.06178](http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.06178). _A method to determine which quantum operations can be realized with linear optics with a constructive implementation recipe_.

  > A recipe for constructing the linear optical device to implement a given quantum operation on n-photon states. This preprint resolves an important open problem (and something that I was curious about for the longest time): given a unitary transformation acting on n photons in m modes, (1) is there a linear optical circuit that exactly implements it? and (2) if yes, then what is the circuit? The answer to the question (1) is: A quantum operation U can be implemented with linear optics if and only if its adjoint is an automorphism (i.e., for any element v in the image subalgebra d , the adjoint UvU† remains in the subalgebra). This can be checked by choosing a basis and checking the consistency of a resulting linear system. The answer to (2) is a constructive recipe of Theorem 2 (Equations 5 and 6) with helpful examples in the appendix. Of course, there might be situations where this algorithm says that the operator cannot be implemented but we could actually implement it using a suitable subset of states.

- Semenenko, H., Sibson, P., Thompson, M. G., & Erven, C. [arXiv:1901.05706](http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05706). _Interference between independent photonic integrated devices for quantum key distribution_. and
- Agnesi, C., Da Lio, B., Cozzolino, D., Cardi, L., Bakir, B. Ben, Hassan, K., Della Frera, A., Ruggeri, A., Giudice, A., Vallone, G., Villoresi, P., Tosi, A., Rottwitt, K., Ding, Y., & Bacco, D. [arXiv:1901.05707](http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05707). _Hong-Ou-Mandel interference between independent III-V on silicon waveguide integrated lasers_.

  > Indium phosphide and Silicon chips for generating indistinguishable weak coherent states. These preprints report two photonic chips with on-chip laser and Mach-Zehnder interferometer for pulse shaping. The resulting coherent states after attenuation are indistinguishable with Hong-Ou-Mandel visibilities at around 46% as compared to the maximum possible 50% values. These results on HOM interference, which is a building block for MDI-QKD, are a step forward from the QKD-enabling [earlier work](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13984) on InP chips.

- Menssen, A. J., Felce, D., Guan, J., Booth, M. J., & Walmsley, I. A. [arXiv:1901.04439](http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04439). _A Photonic Majorana Bound State_.

  > Simulation of Majorana fermion binding to vortex defect realized in a photonic graphene analogue. The simulation uses the idea that a wavefunction evolving under a tight-binding Hamiltonian on crystal lattice is analogous to light propagating in a photonic crystal. A photonic crystal with an astounding 1192 waveguides forms the lattice and a spatial-light modulator is used to initialize the desired state.  

- Magana-Loaiza, O. S., Leon-Montiel, R. de J., Perez-Leija, A., URen, A. B., You, C., Busch, K., Lita, A. E., Nam, S. W., Mirin, R. P., & Gerrits, T. [arXiv:1901.00122](http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00122). _Multiphoton Quantum-State Engineering using Conditional Measurements_.

  > Generation of photon-subtracted two-mode squeezed vacuum states using postselection. A two-mode squeezed vacuum state can be made more correlated by subtracting the same numbers of photons from both the modes. Surprisingly, the photon statistics of the individual modes approach Poissonian distributions, so the resulting state approaches that of an entangled laser. The photon subtraction requires high-efficiency photon number resolving detectors. This experimental implementation is closely connected to an [earlier proposal](https://www.osapublishing.org/josab/abstract.cfm?uri=josab-29-9-2581) on photon-subtracted two-mode squeezed vacuum states.

### July 2018

<!--Here are my reading notes on the quantum optics and photonics preprints in July 2018. This has been a good month for sources of nonclassical light: three groups implemented a source of polarisation-entangled photon pairs using Sagnac interferometer; Vernon et al proposed a CV-squeezed light source based on a χ<sup>(3)</sup> microresonator; and three standards institutes INRIM (Italy), NPL (UK) and PTB (Germany) reported a concerted effort to standardise g<sup>(2)</sup> measurements. On the detection side, Goswami, Heshami and Simon proposed a scheme for the non-destructive detection of single-photon time-bin qubits.-->

  > Non-destructive detection (NDD) of single-photon time-bin qubits via cavity enhancement. This work improves an [earlier](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13454) proposal and proof-of-principle demonstration of time-bin NDD to sensitivity levels that allow for single-photon detection. The sensitivity is improved by introducing a cavity and correcting for undesired probe-dependent phase shifts arising from the cavity.

The effect of these counts can be ameliorated by subtracting long-time-delay coincidences from both the true and the accidental coincidences (Fig. 1). The article also presents a thorough analysis of uncertainties including those from cross-correlations in coincidence counts.

A PDC nonlinearity that is embedded in a Sagnac interferometer generates pairs of photons in the clockwise and in the anti-clockwise paths of the interferometer. Other than cycling direction, these pairs are mutually indistinguishable. While exiting the interferometer, the pairs interfere at a PBS and give an entangled singlet state with near-optimal performance in the relevant metrics of brightness, heralding efficiency and spectral purity.

This work proposes a squeezed light sources based on effective χ<sup>(2)</sup> interaction of an integrated nanophotonic resonator with χ<sup>(3)</sup> nonlinearity when it is driven by a strong continuous wave (CW) pump field. Realistic device parameters suggest a possibility of up to 10 dB squeezing for a 100pJ energy pulse.

### June 2018

<!--Here are my quantum optics and photonics reading notes from June 2018: including a linear interferometer with source and detector on chip and theoretical advances on discriminating distinguishability and on linear bosonic channels.-->

- Lami, L., Sabapathy, K. K., & Winter, A. [arXiv:1806.11042](http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.11042). _All phase-space linear bosonic channels are approximately Gaussian dilatable_.

  > The set of phase-space linear bosonic channels coincides with the closure of Gaussian dilatable channels. The proof relies on showing (i) that the set of linear bosonic channels is strong-operator closed, (ii) that the closure of the set of Gaussian dilatable channels contains it, (iii) [earlier result](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.95.062309) and explicit derivation that every Gaussian dilatable channel is linear bosonic. Taking the closure is necessary as proven from an example of a linear bosonic channel (binary displacement channel) that has no Gaussian dilation even if the ancillary state is allowed to have infinite energy. Theorem 13 provides the main result and Lemma 11 a simplified example. Figure 2 depicts the hierarchy of bosonic channels. This self-contained article provides rigorous proofs yet it reads like a breeze!

- Sun, K., Gao, J., Cao, M., Jiao, Z., Liu, Y., Li, Z., Poem, E., Eckstein, A., Ren, R., Pang, X., Tang, H., Walmsley, I. A., & Jin, X. [arXiv:1806.09569](http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.09569). _Mapping and Measuring Large-scale Photonic Correlation with Single-photon Imaging_.

  > Gratings convert momentum correlations to spatial correlations, which can be measured directly with ICCDs. Short gate times allow extracting correlations between two modes, i.e., joint spectrum, and suppressing noise.

- Aragoneses, A., Islam, N. T., Eggleston, M., Lezama, A., Kim, J., & Gauthier, D. J. [arXiv:1806.05012](http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05012). _Bounding the outcome of a two-photon interference measurement using weak coherent states_.

  > Experiments on weak coherent states give information about events in which HOM interference occurred. By sending in weak coherent pulses and measuring three different coincidence probabilities, the HOM coincidence probability (i.e., one photon emerging from each output port of the beam splitter conditioned on the presence of two incident single-photon wavepackets) can be bonded from above. The results are based on ideas from [this earlier work](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.94.062305) on single-photon simulation via classical light.

- Schwartz, M., Schmidt, E., Rengstl, U., Hornung, F., Hepp, S., Portalupi, S. L., Ilin, K., Jetter, M., Siegel, M., & Michler, P. [arXiv:1806.04099](http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04099). _Fully on-chip single-photon Hanbury-Brown and Twiss experiment on a monolithic semiconductor-superconductor platform_.

  > Fully on-chip Hanbury-Brown-Twiss experiment. First experiment with all three, source, interferometer and detector integrated on the chip. The components comprise a single-photon source via quantum dot (QD) in InGaAs/GaAs, a beamsplitter, and two nanowire detectors on one chip. As expected, the integrated detectors on-chip necessitate operation at 4K. The result shows respectable specifications for a fully on-chip device: QD emission to background ratio of 40:1 and g2(0) of around 0.24 for cw and 0.41 for pulsed scheme, with both the g2 values happily below the 0.5 threshold for dominance of QD single-photon signal.

- Adcock, J. C., Morley-Short, S., Silverstone, J. W., & Thompson, M. G. [arXiv:1806.03263](http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03263). _Hard limits on the postselectability of optical graph states_.

  > Which graph states can and cannot be obtained from photon sources and post-selection? The article starts with a well-motivated definition: a circuit is post-selectable iff all gate failure combinations can be detected, and ignored, i.e., whenever the success signal is observed, all gates have performed their desired operations. Then it presents rules about which circuits can and cannot be post-selected. The first rule, that circuits with cycles of post-selecting gates are not post-selectable, arises from junk terms produced by the first gate creeping into the post-selected basis by the subsequent gates. The other two rules deal with states generated from post-selection on entangled photon pair sources. The algorithm that decides which entanglement classes are accessible can also be used to design interferometers that construct desired graph states.

- Banchi, L., Kolthammer, W. S., & Kim, M. S. [arXiv:1806.02436](http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02436). _Multiphoton Tomography with Linear Optics and Photon Counting_.

  > Linear optics and photon counting allow tomography of arbitrary photonic states. The task is to perform photon-counting detection on many copies of a given state after it has passed through a linear interferometer whose settings can be changed. The state-to-probabilities transformation (Equation 2) can be inverted if enough interferometer settings are measured similar to [earlier work](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.86.4721) on angular momentum tomography. How many settings is enough can be determined using [ideas from unitary design](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10623-009-9290-2). Ancillary linear optics modes and detectors can reduce the number of settings required, even down to a single setting. This article brings together many ideas that are new and interesting to me.

- Kupchak, C., Erskine, J., England, D. G., & Sussman, B. J. [arXiv:1806.01245](http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01245). _THz-bandwidth all-optical switching of heralded single photons_.

  > Kerr effect for fast, low-noise switching that is compatible with quantum light. A strong pump pulse can induce birefringence in a Kerr medium such as a single-mode fiber. This birefringent medium, if sandwiched between crossed polarizers, acts as a fast optically-triggered switch with an incredible 97\% switching efficiency, 80 MHz duty cycles (with 1.7 ps switching time) and 800 SNR (signal/noisy counts).

- Stanisic, S., & Turner, P. S. [arXiv:1806.01236](http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01236). _Discriminating distinguishability_.

  > Construction of HOM-like distinguishability-discriminating interferometers. This article constructs the theory to answer the question: how to find interferometers that have zero coincidence probability from indistinguishable input states but the highest probability of seeing a coincidence for a distinguishable input state? One cool idea to take back home: Schur-Weyl duality in second quantisation is closely connected to Schmidt decomposition in first quantisation (Equations 17, 42, 47, 53). Once the states are converted to first quantisation, then [earlier](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.70.022302) results from the discrimination of two mixed states can be used, subject to linear optics and photo-detection constraints.

  > Experimental verification of loophole-free modified delayed choice experiment. The delayed choice thought experiment highlights a tension between quantum physics and hidden variable models that respect causality. The actual experiment has been performed [earlier](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/315/5814/966.full) and quantum physics emerged unscathed to the surprise of no one. That said, it is good to be careful, and doubly so in light of [this earlier work by Chaves Lemos and Pienaar](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.190401), which showed that the original delayed choice experiment does admit a simple causal hidden variable model. Fortunately the work also provided a modified version in which quantum physics is provably incompatible with causal hidden variables. These two experiments, from Shanghai/Hefei and from Rome have verified that quantum predictions indeed hold even in this modified setting.

### May 2018

<!--Here are the quantum optics gifts that Arxiv brought us in May 2018. I've added more papers this month than ever to my to-read-later list. (Sidenote: It would be cool to check if this bump in interesting quant-ph papers is a result of a bump in submitted quant-ph papers that happens every May when teaching recedes. [Old arXiv stats](https://arxiv.org/help/stats/2011_by_area/index) seem to show that Cond-matt submissions go up in May but not HEP. Funnily enough, the [numbers of downloaded papers](https://arxiv.org/stats/monthly_downloads) show no such bump!) The papers that I did read are:-->

- Wu, J., de Guise, H., & Sanders, B. C. [arXiv:1805.12023](http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12023). _Coincidence Landscapes for Polarized Bosons_\.

  > Group theoretic analysis of tritter and related experiments. This is a rigorous study of coincidences and symmetries in linear interferometry on _m_ channels including polarization using SU(2m) group theory. Expressions for coincidence rates are presented in terms of rate matrices of SU(2m), whose [well-oiled machinery](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.97.063802) suffices for describing  the extra polarization degree of freedom. Section IV 'Triad phase demystefied' explains the triad phase of earlier tritter experiments in terms of pairwise photon-photon distinguishability in an SU(2m) analysis.

- Tan, S.-H., & Rohde, P. P. [arXiv:1805.11827](http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11827). _The resurgence of the linear optics quantum interferometer --- recent advances & applications_\.

  > Up-to-date review on linear optics with a focus on theoretical advances. This review systematically introduces linear optical interferometers and highlights recent advances in encoding and preparing desired quantum states (Sections III, IV, and also in VII, VIII), and state and process tomography (Sections V, VI). I enjoyed the brief and zoomed-out presentation of photodetection and optical switching (Sections IX, X). A comprehensive list of application of linear optics is in Section XI. This review complements very well the other great [recent review](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02790), which is more experiment oriented. A must read for someone entering the field!

- Perczel, J., Kómar, P., & Lukin, M. D. [arXiv:1805.11739](http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11739). _Quantum Optics in Maxwell’s Fish Eye Lens with Single Atoms and Photons_\.

  > A quantum-optical analysis of two atoms in Maxwell’s fish eye lens. A Maxwell's fish eye lens is an infinite sized dielectric with a radial refractive index variation such that light rays propagate in perfect circles, and moreover all rays that are emitted from any point inside the lens meet at its antipodal point. Enclosing the dielectric in a spherical mirror of a specific radius leaves the lens behaviour unchanged. This work is a full quantum optical analysis of the two atoms in a 2D lens interacting via photons in the dielectric. The EM field is quantized rigorously using a set of single-frequency solutions of the Maxwell equations using the framework of [Glauber and Lewenstein](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.43.467). The effective dipole-dipole coupling between the two atoms is independent of the lens radius and thus independent of their distance, which could be useful in quantum optics.
- Scheel, S., & Szameit, A. [arXiv:1805.10876](http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.10876). _PT-symmetric photonic quantum systems with gain and loss do not exist_\.

  > PT-symmetric quantum optics is not possible with gain and loss. Combined parity-time (PT) symmetric Hamiltonians possess real eigenvalues and generate unitary evolutions. One potential approach to realizing PT symmetric Hamiltonians is quantum optics, where complex gain and loss can provide the desired analog for the complex quantum potential. This work shows that this analogy is incomplete because the simple fact that applying gain and loss on a quantum state adds unavoidable noise to the light state, and so the system is not PT symmetric. For me, this was a much-needed reminder that gain and loss in quantum optics is subject to the usual irreversibility of open quantum dynamics.

- Averchenko, V. A., Schunk, G., Förtsch, M., Fischer, M., Strekalov, D. V., Leuchs, G., & Marquardt, C. [arXiv:1805.08467](http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08467). _Off-resonant emission of photon pairs in nonlinear optical cavities_\.

  > Theory and experiment on the effect of frequency mismatch on cavity assisted photon generation. This work is a thorough analysis of photon-pair generation in cavities if the cavity frequency does not match that of the generated photons. The mismatch reduces photon-generation rate, and it distorts the spectrum and the auto-correlation function of the generated light. The results are experimentally validated using a whispering-gallery-mode resonator similar to that demonstrated earlier ([in](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.104.153901) [these](https://physics.aps.org/articles/v3/32) [works](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms2838)).

- Quesada, N., & Brańczyk, A. M. [arXiv:1805.06868](http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06868). _Gaussian functions are optimal for waveguided nonlinear-quantum-optical processes_\.

  > Necessary conditions for a factorizable joint spectral amplitude (JSA) and heuristics for maximizing separability when the conditions are not met. I really like the novel method used here to study the JSA: map the two functions that define the JSA (i.e., the pump field and phase-matching functions) to position wavefunctions of two modes; under this mapping, the final JSA is identical to the position wavefunction of the modes after they are squeezed, rotated and skewed. This mapping allows using an [earlier result](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.88.044301) that Gaussian states are necessary for obtaining an unentangled output from a linear optical interferometer. This means that a JSA can be factorized only if the incident pump field and phase-matching functions are Gaussian. The preprint ends with a conjecture that if either of these functions is non-Gaussian, then maximizing the JSA requires that the other one is Gaussian. The conjecture is supported by analytical calculations in a specific parameter regime and strong numerics.

  > Massively time-multiplexed detection allows for 123 dB intensity range detection. This work is an elegant solution for estimating the photon number of high and low photon number states using standard SNSPD detectors without frying the detectors. It involves modifying [earlier loop-detector proposals](https://www.osapublishing.org/ol/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-28-1-52), which relied on fixed coupling to the loop, to instead use an adaptive coupling realized via a Pockels cell. The to-be-detected light pulse is fed entirely into the loop, and it is allowed to bleed off slowly out of the loop and on to the detector. The detector statistics over many round trips of the light in the loop allows inferring the photon number for a wide range of light intensities. Yet another cool application of an in-loop Pockels cell.

  > Generation and verification of CV entanglement between different OAM modes of the same beam. In this work, continuous variable entanglement is generated between two OAM modes of light using an OPO followed by a q-plate. Homodyne tomography is then performed on the emitted beam of light using another beam with complementary OAM and a [single detector based on an earlier proposal](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1464-4266/7/12/044/meta). The reported homodyne visibitity is an impressive 0.97, and the overall detection efficiency (after accounting for imperfections in photodiodes, qplates and fiber-couplings) is an equally impressive 0.52.

  > Quantum enhancement in the measurement of temporal and spectral separation of light pulses. This work translates ideas from super-resolution imaging (i.e, [quantum-enhanced resolution](https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.6.031033) of two incoherence point sources and estimating their separation) into the time-frequency domain. The time or frequency offset between two light pulses is determined by projectively measuring Hermite-Gauss time-frequency mode. This measurement is performed using sum-frequency generation with shaped ultrafast pulses in specifically engineered nonlinear waveguides. The final result is an impressive ten-fold improved resolution (as compared to the Cramer-Rao bound) of separations that ten times smaller than the spectral bandwidths.

  > Noninteracting bosonic quantum walkers are likely hard to simulate. This work determines the probabilities of detecting noninteracting bosonic quantum walkers in terms of permanents of doubly banded matrices, and these quantities are expected to be hard to compute classically. For me, it was very interesting to see that time-dependent hopping and optical control can yield arbitrary unitary evolutions (Supplementary material Section I).

  > Quantum metrology with multimode photonic states. Current results about metrological scaling beyond the shot-noise limit focus on two single modes of light probing a phase. Single mode states with a fixed and high photon number are hard to generate experimentally, but it can be easier to generate such multi-mode states. For example, Dicke states emitted from a bunch of fully exciting quantum emitters coupled identically to a common photon reservoir. The metrological resource scaling of two such states after they have interfered on a beamsplitter is a main result of this work. Dicke superradiant states, although are highly entangled internally, can achieve the Heisenberg scaling limit. What other multimode states are feasible to generate experimentally and can give a quantum metrological advantage?

### April 2018

<!--Following up from [the March post], April 2018 in quantum optics was just as exciting: from integrated photonics for random number generation and for continuous variable quantum information, to new witnesses of multi-photon indistinguishability and of entanglement, and the release of an open-source photonics front-end/simulator. Here are my reading notes.-->

- Lee, J. P., Villa, B., Bennett, A. J., Stevenson, R. M., Ellis, D. J. P., Farrer, I., Ritchie, D. A., & Shields, A. J. [arXiv:1804.11311](http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11311). _Towards a source of multi-photon entangled states for linear optical quantum computing_.

  > Scheme for generating entangled photonic states using quantum dots. A modification of the [Lindner and Rudolph cluster-state generation scheme](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.113602) from polarization to time-bin encoded photons. The modification also makes the scheme compatible with enhanced Raman scattering, which promises higher indistinguishability. A proof-of-principle demonstration shows that the emitted photons are correlated with the quantum dot.

- Kwon, H., Tan, K. C., Volkoff, T., & Jeong, H. [arXiv:1804.09355](http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09355). _Nonclassicality of Light as a Quantifiable Resource for Quantum Metrology_.

  > Nonclassicality of light (i.e., negativity in its P function) is a resource for quantum metrology. Preposition 1 is a strong claim about pure states: a pure quantum state outperforms all classical states in optical or mean metrological power if and only if the state contains negativity in its P function. Theorem 1 tells us that nonclassicality (in the sense of [monotonicity under linear optics operations](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.190405)) is a resource for the mean metrological power of the state. This means that metrology is yet another way of looking at the classical non-classical divide for light states.

  > Self-Kerr interaction can be approximated by a sequence of cross-Kerr interactions. Real-world self-Kerr interaction [cannot be used](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.73.062305) to [generate large phases](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.81.043823) at the relevant few-photon level. This work proposes an approximate self-Kerr interaction to circumvent the restriction. The approximation is realized by a mirror at the end of a chain of cross-Kerr interaction sites. Many powerful tools developed here, so I need to re-read this!

[arXiv:1804.07435](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07435). _Integrated photonic platform for quantum information with continuous variables_.

  > Integrated waveguide with two-mode squeezed vacua source and electro-optic phase shifters and beamsplitters. Two-mode squeezed vacua are generated in an on-chip periodically poled waveguide. The on-chip fast electro-optic phase shifters and beamsplitters enable the manipulation of the generated nonclassical light and also the interferometric stage of the homodyne detection. The high operational temperature of the waveguide (125°C) allows for large (up to 160 mW) coupled pump power inside the waveguides. Exciting to see where this goes in the future!

  > A demonstration of 3ps jitter in nanowire detectors. This work shows a 5x improvement in photodetector time resolution (jitter), which is the distribution width of the lag between photon arrival time and the signal output time. This is achieved by keeping the nanowire short, so there is less fluctuation in the position along the nanowire at which photons arrive and consequently less fluctuation in the time at the which slow (v = 0.02c) RF pulses reach the amplifiers at the ends of the nanowire. Short nanowires also mean high internal efficiency, which too improves the jitter. This improved resolution comes at the cost of low overall efficiency. Changing the photon wavelength or device temperature changes the jitter, which indicates that the jitter is intrinsic to the detector and not resulting from the instrumentation.

  > Photonic demonstration of duality between realism and information extraction. For a given initial state, the degree of irreality of an observable is quantified by how much its measurement changes the state. For a weak-measurement setting (i.e., the system interacts with an ancilla, which is later measured), irreality and information extraction [are complementary](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.97.022107). Basically, changes in the irreality of an observable are coupled to changes to the system-ancilla mutual information and the ancilla marginal information content. The weak measurement setting is simulated as the interaction of two photons on a polarization beam splitter (like [so](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.73.012113)) and information content is measured by full state tomography on the output photons.

  > Integrated photonics for quantum random number generation. A laser output operating just above the threshold demonstrates random phase fluctuation [because of spontaneous emission](https://www.osapublishing.org/ol/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-35-3-312). This random fluctuating phase is converted into fluctuating light intensity via interferometry. The intensity fluctuations are next converted into voltage fluctuations via a transimpedence amplified and finally digitalized on an oscilloscope into random bits. Integrated optics trades off good quantum-to-classical-noise ratio (~3.4 as compared to [~21 for fiber](https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/abstract.cfm?uri=oe-20-11-12366)) for high stability (>50 minutes) among other advantages.

  > Improved entanglement witness and compressed measurements reveal >7 ebits of entanglement in SPDC output. A [recent entanglement witness](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03626) relies on measuring correlations between pairs of complementary observables. This work shows that the entanglement witness also works if the joint distributions are replaced by compressed distributions. This replacement is then exploited to get similar results with far fewer measurements that are chosen using an image compression approach. Another advance is a less tight witness that is quadratically easier to measure. Together, this allows for witnessing 7.1 ( ebits (bell-pair equivalents) of entanglement, all this without resorting to computational recovery black magic.

  > Arbitrary deterministic time-bin photonic qubits from quantum dots. Quantum dots can use Raman scattering to generate near-deterministic time-bin photonic qubits as shown [earlier](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-9565/aaa7b7/meta) but without full control over the relative phase of the outgoing time bins. This work demonstrates control of the relative phase without resorting to lossy phase modulation on the outgoing light. Instead, control of the phase difference between the outgoing time bins is achieved by modulating the relative phase of the driving pulses. Coupled with the control of the relative amplitude (obtained by modulating the power of the driving pulses), this phase control means that arbitrary qubit (and maybe qudit?) states of time-bin photons can be generated.

  > Two-mode quadrature squeezing is probably necessary for quantum teleportation. This work brings us closer to identifying the resource states for continuous variable quantum teleportation, i.e., what attributes are necessary and sufficient for a, generally non-Gaussian, continuous variable state to be useful for quantum teleportation. Two reasonable candidates have been rejected earlier:  EPR correlations are neither necessary nor sufficient and squeezed vacuum affinity is not necessary. This work tests two-mode quadrature squeezing as a necessary condition and provides numerical evidence that two representative classes of non-Gaussian states (de-Gaussified two-mode squeezed vacuum state and beam-splitter generated non-Gaussian states) require two-mode squeezing as a necessary condition for quantum teleportation. Section V provides a proof that for the specific case of quantum teleportation using symmetric Gaussian states, the two-mode quadrature squeezing is a necessary condition.

  > Stochastic algorithms for finding densest subgraphs are enhanced using biased randomness from Gaussian boson samplers. The problem of finding the densest k-subgraph of a given graph is of broad practical interest and is NP hard so approximate methods are required. The main result here is that samples from a Gaussian boson sampling device can improve the performance of stochastic algorithms. This is done by consulting the sampler in both steps where these algorithms use randomness: exploring a fitness landscape and exploiting its local structure. A specific random graph is chosen for performance testing, one that is difficult for deterministic algorithms to deal with so stochastic methods must be resorted to. For this graph, the hybrid classical-quantum approach of using a Gaussian boson sampler improves performance. The improvement is drastic for small numbers of samples. The general template for enhancements of this types is explained in the companion paper [arXiv:1803.10731](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10731) mentioned above.

  > Gaussian boson sampling is advantageous to stochastic optimization. Current stochastic optimization algorithms use randomness for faster convergence and for escaping local optima. The output of a Gaussian boson sampler can provide randomness, biased randomness no less, which improves the performance of these algorithms. Max-Haf is the canonical optimization problem for Gaussian boson samplers, and the performance of classical algorithms for solving this problem sees distinct improvement if a hybrid quantum-classical approach of consulting Gaussian boson samplers is used. The power of this method lies in the ability to improve solutions to NP hard problems other than Max-Haf (see one paper above for an exciting example!).

  > Recurrence equations for multi-photon transition probabilities applied to beamsplitters and two-mode squeezers. Sequences of multi-photon transition amplitudes over different photon numbers are written in terms of their generating functions. These expressions for beamsplitters look very similar to those of two-mode squeezers. In fact, two-mode squeezer amplitudes are the same as those of a beamsplitter if time is reversed for one of the two modes! The generating functions allow the derivation of recurrence relations for multi-photon transition probabilities; these recursion relations make photon interference explicit as additional terms that are absent for distinguishable particles. The recurrence relations take the beamsplitter-squeezer analogy one step further: for certain parameters, a two-mode squeezer emits no single-photon pair states because of a Hong-Ou-Mandel-like extinction.

  > An elegant integrated-optics demonstration of quantum homomorphic encryption, which enables computation on encrypted data such that the output gives the correct answer when decrypted. In this demonstration, the client encrypts their input state in the polarization degree of freedom of photons, which are impinged at an integrated-waveguide server. The server performs the computation using the path degree of freedom and returns the encrypted answer to the client, who undoes the polarization encryption to obtain the correct answer. For me, this was an invitation to reading more about quantum homomorphic encryption and blind quantum computation.

  > A simulation of measurement-induced effects in quantum physics. This experiment demonstrates how measurements change the dynamics of a quantum walker, an effect that is not expected for classical walkers. The change is encapsulated in the effect of measurements on the recurrence probability, i.e. the likelihood of the walker returning to the origin during the walk. Site-selective measurements, which are a major advance for time-domain quantum walks, are achieved by coupling out specific pulses while other pulses continue (quantum) walking.

Unlike lego blocks, these modules can together implement arbitrary linear optics transformations (average fidelity = 97.5% for fifty random unitaries). The modules use phase shifters in which both modes are heated to shift the phase and this 'push-pull' operation is expected to be more stable as a constant amount of current passes through the heaters.
