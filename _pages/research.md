# Research Interests
------------------

My research interests are in the areas of quantum optics and quantum computation. In quantum optics, I'm working on <span style="font-variant: small-caps"> BosonSampling </span> quantum computation. 


## Group Theory of Linear Interferometers

## Exact Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference

## Complementary observables in linear optics
