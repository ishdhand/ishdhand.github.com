My research is in the areas of quantum optics and quantum computing. I'm working towards beating classical computers by means of a <span style="font-variant: small-caps"> BosonSampling </span> quantum computer. My CV is available [here](https://ishdhand.github.com/CV_Ish_Dhand.pdf).

### News

* **2015-01-30** - I'm co-organizing the Workshop on Multi-Photon Interferometry at Shanghai, China during 7-11 May 2015. The webpage for workshop is up: [MPI-2015](http://mpi2015.org).

* **2014-10-31** - My work on "Group-theoretic Algorithms for Multiphoton Interferometery" with Hubert de Guise and Barry Sanders has been accepted for poster presentation at [QIP-2015](http://quantum-lab.org/qip2015/).

* **2014-05-21** - My paper on the stability of the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition with Barry Sanders has been published in the [Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical 47 (26), 265206](http://iopscience.iop.org/1751-8121/47/26/265206/).  

* **2014-03-14** - I have uploaded our paper on the stability of the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition to the [ArXiV: 1403.3469](http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.3469).
