* I. Dhand, B. C. Sanders and Hubert de Guise, Algorithms for SU(n) boson realizations and D-functions,
[ArXiV: 1507.06274](http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.06274).  
  <Small>Abstract: Boson realizations map operators and states of groups to transformations and states of bosonic systems. We devise a graph-theoretic algorithm to construct the boson realizations of the canonical SU(n) basis states, which reduce the canonical subgroup chain, for arbitrary n. The boson realizations are employed to construct D-functions, which are the matrix elements of arbitrary irreducible representations, of SU(n) in the canonical basis. We demonstrate that our D-function algorithm offers significant advantage over the two competing procedures, namely factorization and exponentiation</Small>.
  
* I. Dhand and B. C. Sanders, Stability of the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition,
[Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical](http://iopscience.iop.org/1751-8121/47/26/265206/) 47 (26), 265206.  [ArXiV: 1403.3469](http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.3469).  
  <Small>Abstract: The Trotter-Suzuki decomposition is an important tool for the simulation and control of physical systems. We provide evidence for the stability of the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition. We model the error in the decomposition and determine sufficiency conditions that guarantee the stability of this decomposition under this model. We relate these sufficiency conditions to precision limitations of computing and control in both classical and quantum cases. Furthermore we show that bounded-error Trotter-Suzuki decomposition can be achieved by a suitable choice of machine precision</Small>.
