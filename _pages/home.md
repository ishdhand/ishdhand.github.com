## CV
----------------

My CV is available [here](https://ishdhand.github.com/CV_Ish_Dhand.pdf).


## Research
----------------

My research focusses on the design, characterization and simulation of linear optics. I have given evidence for the stability of the Trotter-Suzuki decomposition, which promises to reduce the cost of designing interferometers [[J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 47, 265206]](http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1751-8113/47/26/265206) and have devised a decomposition that enables the realization of arbitrary unitary transformations on the spatial and internal modes of light [[Phys. Rev. A 92, 043813]](http://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.92.043813). I have constructed an accurate and precise procedure for the characterization of linear optical interferometers [[arXiv:1508.00283]](http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.00283). Finally, I have devised algorithms that employ permutation symmetries of photons to speed up the simulation of linear optical interferometers [[arXiv:1507.06274]](http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.06274).
